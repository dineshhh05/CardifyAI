  {
    "question": "What is photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water."
  },
  {
    "question": "Where does photosynthesis take place in plants?",
    "answer": "Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, primarily in the leaves, which contain chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for capturing sunlight."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main pigment involved in photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "The main pigment involved in photosynthesis is chlorophyll, which absorbs light most efficiently in the blue and red wavelengths."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the two main stages of photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "The two main stages of photosynthesis are the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions)."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "During the light-dependent reactions, light energy is captured by chlorophyll and used to produce ATP and NADPH, which are then used in the Calvin cycle."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens during the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "In the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed into an organic molecule, and using ATP and NADPH from the light-dependent reactions, glucose is synthesized."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the chemical equation for photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "The chemical equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of water in photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "Water is split during the light-dependent reactions to provide electrons for the electron transport chain, releasing oxygen as a byproduct."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why is photosynthesis important for life on Earth?",
    "answer": "Photosynthesis is crucial because it provides oxygen for aerobic respiration and produces glucose, which is the primary energy source for most organisms."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the role of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis?",
    "answer": "Carbon dioxide is absorbed from the air and is used in the Calvin cycle to form glucose, a key product of photosynthesis."
